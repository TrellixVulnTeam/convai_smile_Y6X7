to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this . when a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm , the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better . if a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety , that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form ( addiction ) that would utilize this new behavior . another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens , a positive reward for a behavior , even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences . consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes , in this case sadness or depression , and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior ( such as snapping a rubber band on the"]}]},
